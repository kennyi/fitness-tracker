## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### **Global Variables**
```javascript
let currentDayIndex = 0;           // Current selected day (0-6)
let actualTodayIndex = 0;          // Today's actual day
let weekOffset = 0;                // Week navigation offset
const daysOfWeek = ['Monday'...];  // Day names array
const workoutIds = ['workout-0'...]; // DOM IDs for workout cards
```

### **Key Objects**
```javascript
// Current workout state
currentWorkout = {
    date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
    exercises: [{name, category, equipment, sets, notes, timestamp}],
    startTime: ISO_STRING,
    endTime: ISO_STRING,
    notes: STRING
}

// Exercise database
exerciseDatabase = {
    categories: {
        'chest': ['Bench Press', 'Push-ups'...],
        'back': ['Pull-ups', 'Rows'...],
        // ... other muscle groups
    }
}
```

### **Core Functions**
```javascript
// Navigation
getCurrentDay()              // Sets today's index
updateDayDisplay()          // Updates UI for current day
goToPreviousDay()          // Navigate to previous day
goToNextDay()              // Navigate to next day

// Progress Tracking
updateDailyProgress()       // Calculates completion %
toggleExercise(checkbox)    // Marks exercise complete/incomplete
saveProgress()             // Saves to localStorage
loadProgress()             // Loads from localStorage

// Workout Logger
openExerciseModal()        // Opens exercise entry modal
saveExercise()            // Saves new exercise to workout
updateWorkoutDisplay()     // Renders current workout

// Data Persistence
saveCurrentWorkout()       // Saves workout to localStorage
loadTodaysWorkout()       // Loads workout for selected date
```
